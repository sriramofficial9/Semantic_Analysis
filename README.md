# Semantic_Analysis


The study of COVID-19 includes work in virology, epidemiology, and clinical medicine. Semantic search can help researchers make connections and get a greater grasp of the virus by facilitating the combination of knowledge from these disciplines. This initiative was likely inspired by the pressing need for current and accurate information about COVID-19. Researchers and healthcare practitioners can easily discover pertinent scientific literature and data to answer important questions concerning the pandemic with the aid of semantic-based search
